# Overview

![Flow](assets/overview.png)

This repo is organised in an argo app of apps pattern leveraging argo application sets to provision and install various helm charts and capabilities into the 
targeted kubernetes clusters

- When the metis app charts are installed either as manifests, or helm this will result in the creation of various argo application sets configured with cluster gen
- These application sets mapping to the metis "chart modules" will create argo applications
- Each application created represent a toolset,operator or workload that will be provisioned into the cluster/s provisioned for a capability

# Repo Structure

There are two folders each containing helm charts used for installing various argocd CRDs.

##charts-modules
These are a collection  of Helm  Charts organised as "modules". Each chart module is a collection of argo applications, ArgoCD config and namespaces config for various related addons , operator and kubernetes workloads.

see [Chart Modules](charts/modules/main.md)

## charts-bootstrap

## metis application sets

The metis appset chart contains a collection of argo [applicationSets](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/application-set/)

The metis argo applications sets will generate argo applications based of the helm charts in this repo.
